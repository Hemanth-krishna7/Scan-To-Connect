#  QR-Based Digital Contact Experiment

##  Project Overview
This project is a web-based experiment that demonstrates how personal contact information can be dynamically encoded into QR codes in real time. Instead of functioning as a traditional application, the project focuses on visualizing how data transforms into machine-readable QR patterns as the input changes.

The experiment is designed to be simple, interactive, and educational, making it suitable for beginners and academic demonstrations.

---

##  Objectives
- To understand how QR codes encode textual data
- To observe real-time changes in QR structure when input data is modified
- To explore data length and encoding behavior visually
- To build a clean, interactive frontend experiment using basic web technologies

---

##  Features
- Live QR code generation without page reload
- Real-time preview of encoded contact data
- Dynamic character count to study data complexity
- Minimal and modern UI with experimental feel
- Fully frontend-based (no backend required)

---

##  Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- QRCode.js (JavaScript library)

---

##  How It Works
1. The user enters a name and phone number.
2. The input data is dynamically formatted into a structured text format.
3. The formatted data is encoded into a QR code in real time.
4. The QR code updates instantly as the user modifies the input.
5. A character counter displays the data length for experimental observation.

##  Experimental Aspect
This project is treated as a digital experiment rather than a standard utility. It allows users to:
- Observe how increasing or decreasing input data affects QR density
- Understand the relationship between data size and QR complexity
- Study live encoding behavior through instant visual feedback

##  How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Enter contact details to observe real-time QR generation.

No installation or server setup is required.

##  Deployment
The project can be deployed easily using GitHub Pages:
1. Upload the project files to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to repository **Settings → Pages**.
3. Select the main branch as the source.
4. Access the live website using the generated URL.

## Future Enhancements
- QR color and style customization
- Download QR code as an image
- Support for additional contact fields (email, organization)
- Dark and light mode toggle
- Comparative analysis of QR data sizes
